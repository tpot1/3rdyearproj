Re-ENABLE THE LOCATION CHECK - AT THE MOMENT IT JUST RETURNS TRUE FOR EVERYTHING
	AND REMOVE ARBITRARY LECTURE TO BE ATTENDED

TURN OFF DEBUG MODE??

ACTUALLY CHECK THE CHECK-IN WORKS, i.e. go to lecture room and try checking in, on laptop and phone



problem: it is including our check in, so we are never faster than ourself :P


Home page
1	fix display for mobile phones - nav bar only spans half of screen, badges interferes with it

3	Display highest achieved streak

3	Display message while checking in code is running


Attendance History

3	When checking for missed lectures, start from the week students start using the system rather than week 1
	(this says they all missed the first week of lectures - might annoy people)

3	Display locations of lectures?

Challenges
1	Re-assess challenges to match the timetable of the class (i.e. remove the 9am one, create one for checking in to both lectures in same week/same lecture for 5 weeks etc)

1	Plan the timings for the challenges

1	Design the badges

2	Means of easily adding new challenges to all users on-the-fly ?
	(should instead define all challenges at the start, but plan when they activate - startsAt time?)

2	Add some pop-up informing the user when they complete a challenge, and updating home page with new badge
	(challengecheck returns completed challs, pass info to javascript which then shows these pop ups)

2	Display completed challenges at the bottom, even after they have expired
