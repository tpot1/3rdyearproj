Attendance History

2	Display dates of weeks as well as week number

3	When checking for missed lectures, start from the week students start using the system rather than week 1
	(this says they all missed the first week of lectures - might annoy people)

3	Display locations of lectures?

Challenges

1	Plan the timings for the challenges

2	Means of easily adding new challenges to all users on-the-fly ?
