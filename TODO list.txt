Try checking in during a lecture from the correct location, to ensure it works

Possibly reduce the area in which you can check in, since its seems to work pretty accurately


Challenges

2	Add a starts-at parameter for challenges? So they start 'spontaneously'

3	Add new challenges for new lectures


Buildings
1	Define new buildings and test them


Lectures

1	deal with double lectures (duration variable)
		-need to incorporate this into checking in so can check in during either lecture
		-need to incorporate this into missedlecturecheck so only defines a lecture as missed if second lecture has finished
	
1	allow multiple locations for a lecture
		-need to incorporate this into checking in
			-have multiple polys for each possible building, and check them all
